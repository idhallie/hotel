Currently, block.rb contains similar functionality that exists in hotel.rb. 
- In block.rb, rooms_available looks within the block and identifies the reservations that have not been claimed and returns an array of 
  reservation instances.
- In hotel.rb find_available_rooms looks at each room and runs the room.available method to dive into each reservation for that room
  to conduct a comparison of dates. It returns an array of available rooms that can be passed as an argument when booking a room.

Currently, when utilizing make_reservation in the Hotel class, it will choose the first room with availability for that date range. This 
could be changed such that the number of reservations each room has incurred is considered. This would spread room utilization more equally 
among rooms.
